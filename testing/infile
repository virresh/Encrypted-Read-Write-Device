Encryted Read/Write Module
Made by : 
Viresh Gupta

This kernel module has two device drivers, each driver initialises it's own
device and uses only that device.

encdevdriver: This driver initialises the encdev character device.
The first write to this device results in initialisation of the Pre-Shared Key.
Subsequent writes are stored and initialised into the module's buffer. Data
should be immediately read after a write. Data and Key both are used in a block
of 128 bytes. 

decdevdriver: This driver initialises the decdev characted device.
The first write to this device results in intialisation of the Pre-Shared Key.
Subsequent writes to this device decodes the Data and stores decoded data in
the modules buffer. Decoded data should be read immediately. Both Data and Key
utilise a block size of 128 bytes.

Implementations:
The block devices are initialised by their first write. The driver associates
the appropriate VFS functions for each of the drivers and utilises them.
To prevent concurrent utilisation of device, each device can be accessed only
by one program. No concurrent encryption and decryption supported.
